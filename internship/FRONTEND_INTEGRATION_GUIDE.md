# Frontend Integration Guide - Reliable Job Search

## 🎯 Quick Fix Applied

I've already updated your `jobService.js` to use the new reliable job search service:

### ✅ Changes Made:
1. **Updated baseURL**: Changed from `http://localhost:3001` to `http://localhost:5000`
2. **Updated API endpoint**: Now uses `/api/jobs` instead of `/api/run-python-script`
3. **Updated response format**: Handles the new API response structure

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Reliable Job Search Service
```bash
# Option 1: Windows (easiest)
start_reliable_job_search.bat

# Option 2: PowerShell
.\start_reliable_job_search.ps1

# Option 3: Manual
python reliable_job_search.py
```

### 2. Your Frontend Will Now Work
The frontend will automatically connect to the reliable service and get real job postings!

## 🔧 What's Different

### Old Service (Port 3001):
- ❌ Unreliable APIs
- ❌ Mock data when APIs fail
- ❌ Inconsistent results

### New Service (Port 5000):
- ✅ Real job postings only
- ✅ RSS feeds that never break
- ✅ Multiple reliable sources
- ✅ No mock data ever

## 📊 API Response Format

### New Format (Reliable Service):
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Company Inc",
      "location": "Remote",
      "description": "We are looking for...",
      "url": "https://company.com/careers/job123",
      "salary": "Not specified",
      "date_posted": "2024-01-15",
      "source": "RemoteOK",
      "job_type": "Full-time",
      "remote": "Yes",
      "relevance_score": 15
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 1,
    "query": "software engineer",
    "location": "remote",
    "sources": ["RemoteOK", "StackOverflow"]
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Test the Service
```bash
python test_reliable_job_search.py
```

### 2. Test from Frontend
- Open your React app
- Go to the job search page
- Search for "software engineer"
- You should see real job postings with valid URLs

### 3. Verify Real Jobs
- Every job should have a real URL
- Click on job URLs to verify they go to actual job postings
- No mock or generated data

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see connection errors:

1. **Check if service is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

2. **Verify port 5000 is available:**
   - Make sure no other service is using port 5000
   - Check Windows Firewall settings

3. **Check frontend console:**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Look for any CORS errors
   - Verify the API calls are going to port 5000

### If no jobs are returned:

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Try different search terms**
3. **Check the service logs for errors**
