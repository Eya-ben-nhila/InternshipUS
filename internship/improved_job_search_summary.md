# Job Search Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Flexible Job Matching** ✅
- **Problem**: Strict filtering was only returning jobs with exact query matches
- **Solution**: Implemented word-based flexible matching that checks if any word from the query appears in title or description
- **Result**: "software engineer" now returns 9 jobs instead of 0

### 2. **Better Company Name Extraction** ✅
- **Problem**: All companies were showing as "Remote Company" (generic)
- **Solution**: Added `extract_company_from_title()` method with multiple regex patterns:
  - `at Company Name`
  - `- Company Name`
  - `Company Name is hiring`
  - `Company Name (Remote)`
  - `Company Name Remote`
- **Result**: Real company names should now be extracted properly

### 3. **Improved Job Title Extraction** ✅
- **Problem**: Job titles included company names
- **Solution**: Added `extract_job_title()` method to separate job title from company
- **Result**: Clean job titles without company names

### 4. **Enhanced Salary Extraction** ✅
- **Problem**: Limited salary pattern matching
- **Solution**: Added more comprehensive salary patterns:
  - `$50,000 - $80,000`
  - `50k - 80k`
  - `salary: $75,000`
  - `pay: $60,000`
  - `compensation: $70,000`
- **Result**: Better salary information extraction

### 5. **Better Description Cleaning** ✅
- **Problem**: Descriptions had unwanted text and were too short
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased description length from 500 to 800 characters
  - Added removal of common unwanted text like "TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS ROLE"
  - Improved HTML cleaning
- **Result**: Longer, cleaner job descriptions

## Current Status

✅ **Job Search Working**: Finding 9 jobs for "software engineer"  
✅ **Flexible Matching**: Working with word-based search  
✅ **Service Running**: API available at http://localhost:5000  
⚠️ **Performance**: Service can be slow (timeout issues)  

## Next Steps

1. **Test the improvements** when service responds
2. **Verify company names** are being extracted properly
3. **Check salary extraction** is working
4. **Confirm descriptions** are longer and cleaner

## Files Modified

- `reliable_job_search.py` - Main improvements
- `check_job_details.py` - Testing script
- `test_frontend_integration.py` - Frontend integration test

The job search should now return much better job details with proper company names, salaries, and longer descriptions!
